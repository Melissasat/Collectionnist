# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: {morning_start: "10:30", morning_end: "15:00", evening_start: "17:00", evening_end: "20:00", index: 1}
# column: value
#
two: {morning_start: "10:30", morning_end: "20:00", index: 2}
# column: value
three: {index: 0}
